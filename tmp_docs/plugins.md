# Plugins

Plugins add support for a type of content to Pulp. For example, the
[file_plugin](https://github.com/pulp/pulp_file) adds support for Pulp to manage files.

Each plugin has its own documentation that contains setup, workflow, and conceptual information:

- [Pulp RPM plugin](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_rpm/).
- [Pulp File plugin](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_file/).
- [Pulp Container plugin](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_container/).
- [Pulp Ansible plugin](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_ansible/).
- [Pulp Debian plugin](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_deb/).
- [Pulp Python plugin](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_python/).
- [Pulp Gem plugin](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_gem/).
- [Pulp Chef Cookbook plugin](https://github.com/pulp/pulp_cookbook/blob/master/README.rst/).
- [Pulp Maven plugin](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_maven/).
- [Ansible GalaxyNG plugin](https://github.com/ansible/galaxy_ng/blob/master/README.md/).
- [Pulp Certguard plugin](https://docs.pulpproject.org/certguard/).
- [Pulp 2-to-3 Migration plugin](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_2to3_migration/).
