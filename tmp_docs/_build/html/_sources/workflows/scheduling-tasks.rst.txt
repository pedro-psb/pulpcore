Scheduling Tasks
================

While Pulp 2 supported scheduling tasks natively, this is no longer a core feature in Pulp 3. Scheduling Pulp tasks
in Pulp 3 can be accomplished using any of the following external tools (and possibly others not on this list).

 * `cron <http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/crontab.html>`_
 * `rundeck <http://rundeck.org/>`_
 * `distributed cron <https://github.com/ivanmp91/distributed-cron>`_
